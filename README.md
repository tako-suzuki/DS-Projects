# Projects
A collection of projects done during internships and current Georgia Tech M.S Computer Science group project. It provides a brief understanding of my domain field.

## Database System Design
This is a course work on Database System Design at GT M.S Computer Science. In this group project, we considered the bussiness needs and constrains of this online item-swapping platform; thereby creating a database system that best mirrors how the company utilize the data and retrieve users information. 

The folder includes the Extended Entity-Relationship Model, the Relational Model and SQL queries on each user interaction. I've only included the parts where I've contributed the most and have neglected the front-end codes on the UI design as I have not contributed much. 


## Bank Campaign Analysis
This individual project showcases my well-rounded understanding of a predictive model project. From assessing the quality of the data using visualization to applying various statistical models to predict bank churn, Python was used to perform all of these steps. With the data being imbalanced, manipulation of data was necessary to achieve our goal.

## Analysis on Marketing Effectiveness using Marketing Mix Model
This analysis uses simple Bayesian MMM to identify which marketing channel is the most effective. The data has been transformed using adstocks and lag to better capture the effect of such on consumer's action. 

## Prisme LinkedIn Web Scraping
This was an intern project with Prisme, Inc. My main responsibility was to write Python codes to web scrape LinkedIn job posting information such as title, location, description, company name, posted at, etc. With the available data, I use natural language process (e.g. Bag of words) to analyze the existing job market particularly for "Data Analyst/Scientist" and directly report to the CEO of the company.
